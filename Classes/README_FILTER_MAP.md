Amend the classes to include the following functionality.
1. Modify the method to add animals or bids to the zoo.
a. Using filter function, add functionality to ensure that only one object of
each animal class can be added to the zoo. For example, zoo can have
only one tiger. If we try to add more, print a message stating, animal
already added.
2. Amend your looking method to use map and reduce function and create a
single string to represent the zoo.
3. Add one method to look at all the canines in the zoo, use a filter function with
lambdas for it.
4. Add a method to filter out tiger in the zoo and look at them. Use regex to
achieve this functionality.
5. Hint: you will have to go over all the animals in the zoo.
