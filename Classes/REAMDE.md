Each of these animal groups have some special characteristics that get passed on to the child.
The child along with the characteristics derived from the parent will also have their own
characteristics. This zoo can save a fixed number of animals and birds and is open to see the
animals in them.
Design and represent the animals and birds in the above diagram as classes in python. Design a
zoo class to house these animals and birds. These classes should obey the requirements below.
Requirements:
1. Each animal has some common features like the number of hands and legs.
a. Felines and canines have 4 legs and no hands.
2. Each bird has a number of legs and number of wings as a feature.
a. Flight birds have 2 legs and 2 wings.
3. Represent these features as attributes.
4. The characteristic for each of the animals are as follows:
a. Felines belong to the cat family.
b. Canines belong to the dog family.
c. Tigers can roar and are lethal predators.
d. Wild cats can climb trees.
e. Wolves hunt in packs and have a leader.
f.
Flight birds fly and hunt for food.
g. Eagles fly extremely high and can see their prey from high up in the sky.
5. Add the characteristics of animals and birds to their respective classes.
6. Create a zoo that can have 2 animals and 1 bird.
7. Zoo should be able to add only an animal or a bird if it is not full.
8. Zoo should be able to provide a way to look at all the animals/birds it has.
9. Looking at animals/birds means you should be able to get all the features and
characteristics of them.



Description
This part is designed to measure and assess your ability to:
● Design and use simple regular expressions.
● Create and use lambdas and higher order functions.
This part of the project builds upon the program you wrote for Part1 – Designing Classes Using
Python. We will use the zoo and all the classes of animals and birds we previously created. Below is
the organizational chart for the classes we created in the previous assignment.
We will provide additional functionality to the zoo class in this part and amend the existing classes.
Instructions
Amend the classes to include the following functionality.
1. Modify the method to add animals or bids to the zoo.
a. Using filter function, add functionality to ensure that only one object of
each animal class can be added to the zoo. For example, zoo can have
only one tiger. If we try to add more, print a message stating, animal
already added.
2. Amend your looking method to use map and reduce function and create a
single string to represent the zoo.
3. Add one method to look at all the canines in the zoo, use a filter function with
lambdas for it.
4. Add a method to filter out tiger in the zoo and look at them. Use regex to
achieve this functionality.
5. Hint: you will have to go over all the animals in the zoo.
11. Looking at animals/birds means you should be able to get all the features and
characteristics of them.
