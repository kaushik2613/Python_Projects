The program should simulate a game between two players, where each player draws cards from a central deck to collect sets of matching cards. The game ends when the deck is empty, and the player with the most sets at the end of the game wins. The program should use QUEUE to represent each player's hand and a STACK to represent the central deck of cards. The game should be playable in the command-line interface, with the option to specify the number of players and the number of cards dealt to each player at the start of the game.\""],"metadata":{"id":"7bt5YSaL3V9M"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import random\n","from collections import deque\n","#insert your code here\n"],"metadata":{"id":"tTGPYU4u5G4x"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
